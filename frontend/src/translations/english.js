  // FAQ Questions and Answers
  howToSetupSystem: "How do I set up my GrapeGuard system?",
  setupSystemAnswer: "GrapeGuard automatically connects to your sensors. Make sure your sensors are properly installed in your vineyard and connected to the system. The dashboard will start showing real-time data once sensors are active.",
  
  whatSensorsNeeded: "What sensors do I need for grape farming?",
  sensorsNeededAnswer: "For optimal grape monitoring, you need: Soil Moisture Sensor, Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Light Intensity Sensor, Rain Sensor, and Battery/Power monitoring. All these help monitor grape health in Western Maharashtra conditions.",
  
  howOftenDataUpdates: "How often does the system update data?",
  dataUpdatesAnswer: "Sensor data is updated every 5-10 minutes automatically. You can also manually refresh data using the refresh button on the dashboard.",
  
  aiAccuracy: "How accurate is the AI disease detection?",
  aiAccuracyAnswer: "Our AI system is trained specifically for Western Maharashtra grape varieties and can detect common diseases like Powdery Mildew, Downy Mildew, Black Rot, and Anthracnose with 85-95% accuracy. Always consult with agricultural experts for final treatment decisions.",
  
  diseasesDetected: "What types of grape diseases can be detected?",
  diseasesDetectedAnswer: "The system can detect: 1) Powdery Mildew (भुरी रोग), 2) Downy Mildew (दवयाचा रोग), 3) Black Rot (काळा रोग), 4) Anthracnose (कर्पा रोग). Each comes with specific treatment recommendations for Maharashtra grape varieties.",
  
  goodPhotos: "How do I take good photos for disease detection?",
  goodPhotosAnswer: "For best results: 1) Take photos in good natural light, 2) Focus on individual leaves showing symptoms, 3) Ensure the leaf fills most of the frame, 4) Avoid blurry or dark images, 5) Take multiple angles if disease is unclear.",
  
  treatmentSafety: "Are treatment recommendations safe for my grapes?",
  treatmentSafetyAnswer: "Yes, all recommendations are based on organic and approved methods for grape farming in Western Maharashtra. However, always test on a small area first and follow local agricultural guidelines.",
  
  alertColors: "What do the different alert colors mean?",
  alertColorsAnswer: "Red (Critical): Immediate action required - may affect grape health. Yellow (Warning): Monitor closely - trending toward problematic levels. Blue (Info): General information or minor deviations from optimal.",
  
  humidityLevels: "When should I be concerned about humidity levels?",
  humidityLevelsAnswer: "For grapes in Western Maharashtra: Humidity >85% increases disease risk (especially during monsoon), Humidity <40% may cause plant stress. Optimal range is 40-60% for healthy grape growth.",
  
  soilMoistureLevels: "What are optimal soil moisture levels for grapes?",
  soilMoistureLevelsAnswer: "Grapes prefer well-drained soil: 30-75% moisture is optimal. >85% may cause root rot, <20% causes drought stress. Adjust irrigation based on soil moisture readings and weather conditions.",
  
  batteryImportance: "Why is my battery voltage important?",
  batteryImportanceAnswer: "Battery voltage below 9V may cause sensor failures. The system automatically switches to backup battery when needed. Regular monitoring ensures continuous data collection for your farm.",
  
  sensorsNotWorking: "What if my sensors stop working?",
  sensorsNotWorkingAnswer: "Check: 1) Power connections and battery voltage, 2) Sensor physical condition, 3) Weather damage, 4) Network connectivity. If issues persist, contact support with your sensor model and error details.",
  
  updateLocation: "How do I update my farm location?",
  updateLocationAnswer: "Go to Profile Settings → Account Information → Location field. Update your location to get accurate weather and disease risk predictions for your specific area in Maharashtra.",
  
  exportData: "Can I export my farm data?",
  exportDataAnswer: "Currently, you can view historical data in charts and alerts. Data export features are coming soon. Your analysis history is automatically saved for your reference.",
  
  dataSecure: "Is my farm data secure?",
  dataSecureAnswer: "Yes, all data is encrypted and stored securely. Only you have access to your farm data. We follow strict privacy guidelines and never share your information without consent.",
